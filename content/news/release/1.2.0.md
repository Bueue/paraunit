+++

This release contains only support for newer versions of PHP & PHPUnit; due to PHPUnit 9.3 requiring a new major version of `phpunit/php-code-coverage`, I'm forced to drop support to all PHPUnit versions below 9.3. Usage of Paraunit is unchanged.

Here's the full changelog of the release:

### Added
 * Add support for PHP 8.0 [#154](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/154)
 * Add support for PHPUnit 9.3 [#153](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/153)
### Removed
 * Drop support for PHPUnit < 9.3 [#153](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/153)
